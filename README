Motivated by stb, this is my own standard library collection.
`gs' is short for GrooveStomp - my online handle.

    gs_bool.h:
    gs_string.h:
    gs_char.h:

In the future I may add more, like:

    gs_clexer.h
    gs_cparser.h
    gs_raster.h

Usage:

    Just drop the file into your project, `#define' a constant for it _once_ and
    add a `#include "..."'.
    eg.:

        #define gs_bool
        #include "gs_bool.h"
        ...

To Do:

- unicode string and char support?
- Compact common utilities into a single header file?
